They leverage RedirHub's API to programmatically manage vanity URLs for their customers or handle dynamic routing rules. The support for wildcard subdomains and path preservation is critical for handling application-wide routing changes without code deploys.Target Personas(Champion: Lead Backend Developer)CTO(Executive, C-Level)Lead Backend Developer(Engineering, Lead)Product Manager(Product, Manager)Switching IntelligenceBarrier:Developer ego ('We can build this in-house'), technical debt prioritizationTrigger:Rebranding (domain change) or maintenance burden of internal redirection scriptsReal Story:"We rebranded from .io to .com. The engineering team said they'd handle the redirects, but they missed the deep links and the wildcard logic. Now our help center links are 404ing, and support ticket volume spiked 200%. We need a set-and-forget solution that handles wildcards correctly so my devs can go back to building the actual product."Pain Points- • Complex wildcard regex failure ("Broken dynamic paths caused 15% churn on help documentation")
