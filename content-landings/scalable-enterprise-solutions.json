  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I replace Nginx or Apache redirects with a managed service?",
      "answer": "Replacing self-hosted redirect configs with a managed service involves exporting your existing redirect rules, importing them via CSV or API, then updating DNS to route traffic through the new service. The main advantage is eliminating SSH access for simple changes, removing manual SSL certificate management, and decoupling redirect changes from deployment pipelines. RedirHub accepts bulk CSV imports and provides a REST API for full migration automation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I automate redirects for multiple domains?",
      "answer": "Yes. The RedirHub API supports full programmatic control — creating, updating, and deleting redirects across any number of domains without using the dashboard. Combined with CSV import/export, you can automate bulk updates, sync redirect rules with internal systems, and integrate redirect management into CI/CD pipelines or custom tooling."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I scale redirects globally without latency issues?",
      "answer": "Yes. Redirects are served from the edge location nearest to each user — delivering sub-100ms response times globally without centralized server bottlenecks. The infrastructure auto-scales under traffic spikes automatically, and redundant nodes across regions maintain 99.99% uptime even during regional outages."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do enterprise URL redirects handle security and compliance?",
      "answer": "Enterprise redirect management should include automatic HTTPS on all redirects, DDoS protection at the infrastructure level, and role-based access control so only authorized team members can create or modify rules. RedirHub includes all three by default, along with access logs for audit trails and data storage in US and EU regions to meet data residency requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I monitor and report on enterprise redirects?",
      "answer": "Yes. Real-time analytics are available across all domains and redirects — tracking traffic volume, geographic breakdown, device data, and errors. Data can be exported in CSV format for integration with enterprise dashboards or BI tools, and scheduled weekly and monthly email reports provide automated summaries without requiring manual exports."
