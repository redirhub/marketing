  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I track how many clicks a redirect gets?",
      "answer": "Every redirect in RedirHub has a built-in analytics view showing total clicks, unique visitors, and hourly distribution. Open any redirect from the dashboard to see its full traffic history. For aggregate views across all redirects, the main analytics dashboard shows performance across your entire account."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I see where redirect traffic is coming from?",
      "answer": "Yes. Each redirect tracks geographic data at country and city level, plus device type and browser breakdown. This tells you whether your traffic is coming from mobile or desktop, which regions are most active, and how your audience is distributed — without needing a separate analytics tool."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get redirect performance reports automatically?",
      "answer": "RedirHub sends weekly and monthly performance summaries by email — covering click totals, traffic trends, and top-performing redirects. These reports arrive automatically with no setup required. For custom reporting, raw log data can be exported in CSV format or piped to your own analytics infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What data does redirect analytics track?",
      "answer": "RedirHub tracks total clicks, unique visitors, QR code scans, geographic location (country and city), device type, browser, and recent activity timestamps for every redirect. All data is available in real time — updates appear as hits arrive, not on a delay."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I track QR code scans separately from URL clicks?",
      "answer": "When a QR code is enabled for a redirect, scans are counted separately from direct URL clicks in the analytics view. This lets you measure the performance of offline campaign assets — print, packaging, signage — independently from your digital traffic without creating separate redirects."
