  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much link equity do 301 redirects actually pass?",
      "answer": "Google's John Mueller confirmed that 301 redirects pass the same link equity as direct links—essentially 100%. The commonly cited \"90-99%\" figure accounts for potential indexing delays, not actual loss. Properly implemented 301s preserve your rankings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I keep 301 redirects active?",
      "answer": "Permanently. Google recommends keeping 301 redirects active for at least one year, but best practice is indefinitely. Backlinks can remain active for years, and removing redirects causes those links to break, losing accumulated authority."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will 301 redirects hurt my page speed or Core Web Vitals?",
      "answer": "RedirHub's global edge network delivers redirects in under 100ms—faster than most server response times. This minimizes latency impact. However, redirect chains (multiple hops) do slow pages down, which is why our system automatically detects and warns about chains."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I redirect an entire domain with wildcard rules?",
      "answer": "Yes. RedirHub supports wildcard patterns that redirect all paths from olddomain.com/* to newdomain.com/* while preserving the exact path structure. This is the safest way to handle full domain migrations without manually mapping every URL."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly do search engines recognize new 301 redirects?",
      "answer": "Search engines process 301 redirects during their next crawl of the old URL. For frequently crawled pages, this happens within days. Less popular pages may take weeks. RedirHub's monitoring shows you exactly when redirects are being followed and by which bots."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between 301 and 308 redirects?",
      "answer": "Both are permanent redirects, but 308 is stricter—it forces the same HTTP method (POST stays POST). For most SEO use cases, 301 is the standard choice. RedirHub supports both, and we'll recommend which to use based on your specific migration scenario."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I track which old URLs are still receiving traffic?",
      "answer": "Yes. RedirHub's analytics show click counts per redirect, including referrer sources and geographic data. This helps you identify which old URLs still have active backlinks or bookmarks, so you can prioritize maintaining those redirects indefinitely."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I import a large redirect map from Google Search Console?",
      "answer": "Export your crawl errors from Search Console, clean the data in Google Sheets or Excel, format as CSV with 'old_url,new_url' columns, and upload to RedirHub. Our bulk import validates the mappings and warns about potential issues before going live."
