  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I give team members access to redirect management?",
      "answer": "Invite team members by email from the team settings in your RedirHub account. Each person gets their own login — no shared credentials. You assign a role during the invite that determines what they can see and change, from full admin access down to view-only."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can different team members have different permission levels?",
      "answer": "Yes. Role-based permissions let you assign different access levels to different team members — for example, a developer with full admin access and a marketer with the ability to create and edit redirects but not delete domains. Permissions can be updated at any time from the team settings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I let marketing update redirects without developer access?",
      "answer": "Assign marketers a role that allows them to create and edit redirects in the dashboard without access to domain configuration or team settings. This lets them launch and update campaign links independently — no ticket to IT, no waiting for a developer — while keeping infrastructure-level settings protected."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does redirect management support SSO login?",
      "answer": "Yes. RedirHub supports SSO (Single Sign-On), allowing your team to log in through your organization's identity provider. This centralizes access management — when a team member is offboarded in your identity system, their RedirHub access is revoked automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I remove a team member's access immediately?",
      "answer": "Remove a team member from the team settings in your account — their access is revoked instantly. Any redirects or configurations they created remain in place. This is important for offboarding — access is cut off without any disruption to live redirects."
