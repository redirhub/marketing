  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I let buyers contact me directly?",
      "answer": "Redirect to your for sell page or your social media, or contact form. Unlike traditional parking that forces buyers through their platform (taking a commission), you get full control. No middleman fees, no forced broker involvement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I capture traffic from expired domains?",
      "answer": "Yes. Expired domains often get traffic from old backlinks for months or years. Redirect to your main site using a 301 redirect to preserve SEO value and capture 100% of that traffic. Analytics show which domains still get real visitors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need hosting or technical setup?",
      "answer": "No. Just add your domain, paste your destination URL, and the redirect is live in 60 seconds. Automatic HTTPS, DNS management, and infrastructure are all handled for you. No hosting account, no server, no technical knowledge required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will redirecting hurt my domain's SEO?",
      "answer": "No. A proper 301 redirect passes nearly 100% of link equity to your destination. RedirHub uses 301 redirects by default over HTTPS, maintaining trust signals and ranking power. Redirecting to relevant content is far better than showing a dead page."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I track domain traffic?",
      "answer": "Real-time analytics show total visits, unique visitors, geographic breakdown, and referrer sources for each domain. See which domains are traffic assets worth developing versus idle inventory. Export data to make informed portfolio decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I change redirects without downtime?",
      "answer": "Yes. Update your destination URL anytime and it goes live globally within seconds—no DNS delays, no downtime. Switch from blog to affiliate offer to 'for sale' page as often as you want with zero interruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between parking and redirects?",
      "answer": "Traditional parking shows ads—the company earns from clicks and shares a small percentage. Redirects send visitors directly to YOUR destination with zero ads and 100% value to you. Better for SEO, conversions, and professional appearance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I redirect multiple domains at once?",
      "answer": "Use CSV bulk import to upload hundreds or thousands of domains in one file. All go live within seconds. For domain groups sharing one destination, clone redirect rules across the entire group instantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for affiliate marketing?",
      "answer": "Yes. Redirect domains directly to your affiliate offers instead of showing generic ads. Set up A/B testing, configure fallback URLs, and use UTM tracking. All revenue goes to you, not a parking middleman."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to SEO if I show ads on a parking page?",
      "answer": "Ad-heavy pages can harm SEO. Google views ad-only pages as low-quality, risking penalties or de-indexing. Clean 301 redirects to relevant content are better—they pass link equity and search engines see them as legitimate."
