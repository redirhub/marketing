  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I let buyers contact me directly without a parking company middleman?",
      "answer": "Set up a clean landing page redirect that displays your contact information front and center—your email, phone, or contact form. Unlike traditional parking services that force buyers through their platform (and take a commission), RedirHub gives you full control over buyer communication. You can create a simple 'For Sale' page with your details, or redirect to your personal website where buyers can reach you directly. No middleman fees, no forced broker involvement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I redirect an expired domain to my main site to capture backlink traffic?",
      "answer": "Yes. Expired domains often continue receiving traffic from old backlinks for months or years after expiration. Instead of letting those visitors hit a dead page, redirect the expired domain to your main site, blog, or client site using a 301 permanent redirect. This preserves SEO value by passing link equity to your destination, and captures 100% of the backlink traffic that would otherwise be wasted. RedirHub's analytics show you which expired domains still get real traffic so you know which ones are worth redirecting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need hosting or technical setup to park my domains?",
      "answer": "No. Traditional domain parking requires setting up hosting, cPanel access, or complex DNS configurations. With RedirHub, you simply add your domain, paste your destination URL, and the redirect is live globally in 60 seconds. Automatic HTTPS provisioning, DNS management, and infrastructure are all handled for you—no hosting account, no server, no technical knowledge required. You can manage 1,000 domains from one dashboard without touching a single DNS panel."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will redirecting my domain hurt its SEO value?",
      "answer": "No—if done correctly. A proper 301 permanent redirect passes nearly 100% of link equity to the destination URL, preserving SEO value. The mistake that hurts SEO is using temporary redirects (302) or creating redirect chains (A → B → C). RedirHub uses proper 301 redirects by default and serves them over HTTPS, which maintains trust signals and passes full ranking power. For expired domains with backlinks, redirecting to a relevant active site is far better for SEO than letting the domain show a dead page."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my parked domains are getting traffic?",
      "answer": "RedirHub provides real-time analytics for every domain showing total visits, unique visitors, geographic breakdown, and referrer sources. This tells you which domains get real human traffic versus just bot crawlers. For domain investors, this data is critical—it reveals which parked domains are hidden traffic assets worth developing or commanding higher sale prices, versus idle inventory that can be dropped. You can export this data to make portfolio decisions based on actual traffic value, not guesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I change where my domain redirects without causing downtime?",
      "answer": "Yes. Update your destination URL anytime and the change goes live globally within seconds—no DNS propagation delays, no downtime. This flexibility means you can switch strategies on the fly: redirect to your blog today, switch to an affiliate offer tomorrow, then change to a 'for sale' page next week. There's no limit on how many times you can change destinations, and visitors always land where you intend with zero interruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between domain parking and domain redirects?",
      "answer": "Traditional domain parking displays a page filled with ads—the parking company earns revenue from clicks and shares a small percentage with you. Domain redirects send visitors directly to YOUR chosen destination—your main site, offer, or landing page—with zero ads and 100% of the value going to you. For most domain owners, redirects are far more valuable: expired domains send backlink traffic to your money site, 'for sale' domains show a clean professional page to buyers, and affiliate domains point directly to your offers without ad clutter diluting conversions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I redirect multiple domains at once?",
      "answer": "Use CSV bulk import to upload hundreds or thousands of domains with their destinations in a single file. Prepare a spreadsheet with source domain and destination URL columns, upload it to RedirHub, preview the mappings, and publish. All domains go live within seconds. For domain groups that share the same destination (like pointing 50 TLD variations to one main site), you can clone redirect rules across the entire group instantly—no repetitive manual setup required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use domain parking for affiliate marketing?",
      "answer": "Yes—and redirects work better than traditional parking for affiliates. Instead of showing generic ads (where the parking company takes most of the revenue), redirect your domains directly to your affiliate offers. You can set up A/B testing to rotate traffic between different offers and see which converts best, configure fallback URLs so traffic doesn't get wasted when an offer goes down, and use UTM tracking to measure which domains drive actual conversions. All revenue goes to you, not a parking middleman."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to my domain's SEO if I show ads on a parking page?",
      "answer": "Ad-heavy parking pages can harm SEO. Google views pages that exist solely to display ads as low-quality, which can result in ranking penalties or de-indexing. If your domain has valuable backlinks, those links become worthless when pointed at an ad-filled parking page. Clean redirects to relevant content are far better for SEO: 301 redirects pass link equity, visitors get a real destination instead of ads, and search engines see the redirect as legitimate rather than a spam tactic. For expired domains with SEO value, redirecting is always better than parking with ads."
