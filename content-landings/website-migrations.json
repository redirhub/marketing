  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I set up 301 redirects for a website migration?",
      "answer": "Setting up 301 redirects for a migration involves mapping every old URL to its new destination, then publishing those rules so search engines and users are forwarded correctly. The most efficient method is building a URL mapping in CSV format — source URL, destination URL, redirect type — and uploading it in bulk. RedirHub publishes the full mapping globally in seconds, with validation to catch broken destinations before they go live."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my SEO be affected during migration?",
      "answer": "Not if redirects are configured correctly. 301 permanent redirects signal to search engines that content has moved — preserving link equity and rankings. Temporary or missing redirects cause search engines to treat old pages as deleted, which drops rankings. Serving all redirects over HTTPS is equally important — an insecure hop in the chain can dilute the trust signals passed between URLs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do redirect chains hurt SEO?",
      "answer": "Yes. Redirect chains — where a URL redirects through multiple hops before reaching its destination — dilute link equity at each step and increase page load latency. Search engines recommend keeping redirect paths to a single hop. When migrating, map every old URL directly to its final destination rather than routing through intermediate URLs. This preserves as much link equity as possible and keeps redirect speed fast."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did my traffic drop after a website migration?",
      "answer": "Traffic drops after a migration are usually caused by missing or misconfigured redirects — old URLs returning 404 errors instead of forwarding to their new equivalents. Search engines then index those URLs as dead pages, dropping their rankings. Other causes include redirect chains diluting link equity, non-HTTPS redirects signalling insecurity, or destination URLs returning errors. Monitoring redirect health after launch catches these issues before rankings are permanently affected."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast are redirects applied during migration?",
      "answer": "Redirects go live globally within seconds of being published — propagating across RedirHub's edge network instantly. There is no deployment pipeline or DNS propagation delay to wait for."
