  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why does my redirect show a \"Not Secure\" warning?",
      "answer": "A \"Not Secure\" warning appears when a redirect is served over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This happens when the domain has no SSL certificate configured, or when a redirect forces traffic through an insecure hop before reaching the destination. RedirHub provisions SSL certificates automatically for every domain — HTTP visitors are silently upgraded to HTTPS so browsers never show a security warning."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I force HTTPS on all my redirects?",
      "answer": "In RedirHub, HTTPS is enforced automatically — every redirect is served over a secure connection by default. HTTP requests are upgraded to HTTPS before forwarding, and wildcard SSL certificates cover all subdomains of a domain. No manual configuration is needed, and certificates renew automatically before expiry."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS redirects for SEO?",
      "answer": "HTTPS redirects are strongly preferred for SEO. Google uses HTTPS as a ranking signal and marks HTTP pages as \"Not Secure\" in Chrome — which reduces click-through rates. When a redirect chain includes an HTTP hop, the trust signal passed between URLs is weakened. Serving all redirects over HTTPS ensures the full link equity is preserved and users see no security warnings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I stop bots from abusing my redirects?",
      "answer": "Bot protection in RedirHub filters traffic at the edge — blocking malicious crawlers and scrapers before they consume your request quota or skew your analytics. Legitimate search engine bots such as Googlebot are allowed through to ensure your redirects remain crawlable. Security plugins can be configured per redirect for additional control on high-value destinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is redirect traffic data stored securely?",
      "answer": "Yes. Redirect traffic data is processed and stored in US and EU regions. Access to your account data is protected by role-based permissions — only authorized team members can view analytics or configuration. All platform access is individual and traceable, with no shared credentials."
