  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I find and fix a broken redirect?",
      "answer": "Search for the redirect by source URL or destination in the dashboard. If the destination is returning errors, the health check indicator will flag it. Update the destination URL directly in the dashboard — the change goes live globally within seconds. Setting a fallback destination ensures traffic is never sent to a dead page while you investigate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if a redirect destination goes down?",
      "answer": "If a destination URL returns an error or goes offline, the redirect will continue forwarding traffic to that broken URL unless a fallback is configured. RedirHub's destination health checks monitor your redirect destinations automatically and alert you when one fails, so you can update or redirect to a fallback before users are affected."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I disable a redirect without deleting it?",
      "answer": "You can enable or disable any redirect with a single click from the dashboard — the redirect rule is preserved but stops forwarding traffic immediately. This is useful for pausing seasonal campaigns, maintenance windows, or rolling back a change without losing the configuration."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I organize redirects across multiple domains?",
      "answer": "Use tags to group redirects by domain, campaign, or project — then filter your dashboard view to just that group. For team access, domain-level permissions mean each team member or client only sees the redirects relevant to their domain, keeping large multi-domain accounts manageable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I bulk edit redirects?",
      "answer": "Select multiple redirects using the bulk selection tool, then apply a mass action — enable, disable, retag, or delete — across all selected items at once. For destination updates at scale, export your redirect list to CSV, edit the relevant fields, and re-import the updated file."
