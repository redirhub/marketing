  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why are UTM parameters lost in redirects?",
      "answer": "UTM parameters are lost when a redirect drops query strings before forwarding traffic to the destination. This breaks campaign attribution — clicks appear as direct traffic instead of being tied to their source. The fix is configuring the redirect to preserve or append query strings. RedirHub's query string forwarding and built-in UTM builder ensure parameters always reach the destination intact."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do affiliate and campaign links get flagged or banned?",
      "answer": "Campaign and affiliate links get flagged by ad networks like Facebook and Google when they use shared shortener domains with poor reputation histories. If one user on a shared shortener violates platform policies, the entire domain can be blacklisted — taking every other user's campaigns down with it. Using your own branded custom domain for redirects eliminates this shared reputation risk entirely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I run A/B testing with my redirects?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can split traffic randomly across multiple destination URLs from a single source link — useful for testing different landing pages, offers, or messaging. Traffic is distributed automatically and you can swap or pause variations instantly from the dashboard without changing the link or running a deployment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I monitor campaign performance in real time?",
      "answer": "Yes. Real-time analytics are available for every redirect — showing total clicks, unique visitors, geographic breakdown, and device data as hits arrive. You can drill into any individual campaign link to see its full traffic history, or export data in CSV format for deeper analysis in your own tools."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I track which campaign channels are driving the most clicks?",
      "answer": "Attach UTM parameters to every campaign redirect — source, medium, and campaign name — so your analytics tool can attribute each click to its correct channel. RedirHub's built-in UTM builder applies these parameters automatically to every hit, so you don't need to manually append them to destination URLs or risk them being stripped mid-redirect."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I automate campaign redirects?",
      "answer": "Yes. Using the RedirHub API, you can programmatically create, update, and manage campaign redirects — useful for automating link generation at scale, integrating with internal tools, or managing campaigns across large numbers of destinations without manual dashboard work."
