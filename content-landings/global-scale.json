  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How does redirect latency affect SEO and conversions?",
      "answer": "Redirect latency adds to a page's total load time — even a few hundred milliseconds increases bounce rates and signals slower performance to search engines. Google's Core Web Vitals measure load speed, and a slow redirect hop contributes negatively. Edge-based redirects resolve in sub-100ms because the request is handled by the nearest server to the user, rather than routing back to a central origin."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an edge network and why does it matter for redirects?",
      "answer": "An edge network is a system of distributed servers positioned close to users around the world. Instead of every redirect request travelling to a central server, it is handled by the nearest edge node — dramatically reducing latency. For redirects, this means users anywhere in the world experience near-instant forwarding rather than waiting for a round trip to a distant server."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a redirect service handle millions of requests per day?",
      "answer": "Yes. RedirHub's infrastructure auto-scales to absorb traffic spikes automatically — there is no manual capacity planning required. The edge network distributes load across global nodes, so high-traffic events such as campaign launches or viral traffic spikes do not degrade redirect performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What uptime does a redirect service guarantee?",
      "answer": "RedirHub maintains 99.99% uptime across its global edge network, backed by redundant infrastructure and automatic failover between nodes. If a node becomes unavailable, traffic is rerouted instantly — users experience no downtime."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I redirect domains for users in different countries?",
      "answer": "Redirect rules in RedirHub apply globally — all users, regardless of location, are forwarded by the nearest edge node. For international domain portfolios, wildcard domain redirects can point an entire domain or subdomain to a destination in one rule. IDN (International Domain Name) support ensures non-Latin domain names are handled correctly without encoding issues."
